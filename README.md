# MOMM-RFT

This repository is for the source code for the Methane-Ozone Mortality Model - Reduced Form Tool (MOMM-RFT)

The MOMM-RFT is designed to quantify the global repiratory-related mortality that is attributbale to long-term exposure to ozone, chemically produced from a marginal pulse of methane. 

This repository contains the relevant input files, model source code, and model data pre- and post-processing scripts.
